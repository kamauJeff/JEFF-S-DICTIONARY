# Jeff's Dictionary

Lightweight React + TypeScript dictionary app that fetches word definitions from dictionaryapi.dev and displays the first meaning with a simple Tailwind-styled UI.

## Features
- Controlled input with validation
- Fetches definitions from dictionaryapi.dev
- Shows result or error messages
- Minimal Tailwind UI using modular Card and Button components

## Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server — check package.json to confirm the correct script
npm start
# or for Vite projects:
npm run dev
```

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter a word in the search field.
3. Press "SEARCH" — the app will display the first available definition or an error.

## Notes
- The app uses https://api.dictionaryapi.dev for definitions.
- If you see no result, verify the word spelling or check network/console for API errors.
- Check `package.json` if a different start/build script is used.

## Contributing
PRs and issues are welcome. Keep changes focused and add tests where appropriate.
